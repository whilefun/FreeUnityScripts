//
// Debug Helper
// A small project that lets you visually debug stuff in Unity
//

A basic test project that demonstrates how to setup objects to have their own small debug canvas for easier visual debugging. See TestScene.unity for example, or look at DebugHelper.gif for reference.

All of the debug stuff only appears in Editor or Development Builds, and is automatically removed from production builds so your finished game won't be slower as a result.

Enjoy!
