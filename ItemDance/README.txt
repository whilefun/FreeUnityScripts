Each element (rotate, bounce, and color change) can be individually enabled and
disabled, with configurable inspector variables (e.g. how fast to rotate, which
colors to use, etc.). These are all fully documented at the top of the source
code. I've set them to some reasonable defaults, to give a nice "Quake III 
Arena" feel :)

Enjoy!
