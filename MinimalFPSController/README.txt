This project is compatible with Unity 4.6.3 and Unity 5. It is a reduced and slightly enhanced version of the Unity 5 Standard Asset FPS Character Controller.

Key Additions:
-Toggles for MouseLook, Player Movement, and Running
-Slightly quieter footstep and jump/land sounds
-Reduced "View Bob"


Enjoy!
