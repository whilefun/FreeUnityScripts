This is based on the Unity Standard Asset "First Person Controller" scripts. It has been ported to C#, and contains a number of additions such as crouch, run, and various toggles for freezing player movement, mouse look, etc. It also includes a demo scene and debug helper for controls and player controller state display.

Enjoy!
