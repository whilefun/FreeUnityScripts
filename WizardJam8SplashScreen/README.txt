Description:
-----------
A splash screen for Wizard Jam 8. Requires Unity 5.5.4p3 or higher.


How to Use:
----------

1) Put the WizardJam8Splash folder into your Assets folder.
2) Ensure the WizardJam8Splash.unity scene is included in your build settings "scenes" at an index above your first scene. For example, if WizardJam8Splash.unity is at scene 0, it will load scene 1 when the splash animation finishes.
3) Adjust the things you want to adjust in the Inspector. More adjustments can be made in the code itself, of course.
